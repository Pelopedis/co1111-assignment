             and can be recovered when the user enters the game 
          2) Namu will add a loader element to indicate that the question is being loaded at the start of the game
          3) Marina will work on adding an alert dialog when a name is already in use and 
             will add an error message when future games are not available. 
             
03/03/21: In general, we disgussed about further improvements in our project: 
          1) Christos will continue working on cookie function so that the session progress is saved and 
             will also work on the location function so it updates the location 
             before answering a question for location-sensitive question
          2) Namu will add an instructions section, that includes info about how to play the game, in the index.html (homepage). 
             Will add the loader element to questions html page and will make css changes in app html
            (remove some boxes and borders around treasure hunt list).
          4) Marina will fix some css issues regarding the qr code (camera frame) and css changes on scoreboard,
             question index and current score elements in question html page (make them not clickable).
             Will also add description/role on index page
